# Assert checker

This is a simple assertion checker written in C, then rewrote in Rust

## Usage

1. Download the code ( `git clone https://github.com/Greensky-gs/assert-checker` or via download )
2. Switch to `rusty` branch if you cloned via git ( `git checkout rusty` )
3. Compile the code ( using `cargo` : `cargo build --release`, or using the makefile : `make release` )
4. Run the program ( `./target/release/assert-checker` for instance, if you're on a windows CMD )
5. Follow the prompts to enter your assertions and check the truth table
